```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```
```{r}
malaria <- read_csv("data/malaria.csv") %>% clean_names
```

1. Make the data tidy and store them as a new object.
```{r}
malaria_long <- malaria %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=starts_with("malaria_rdt"), # pivot bc there is data in column names
               names_to = "age_class",
               values_to = "cases") %>%
  select(data_date, submitted_date, location_name, district, age_class, cases)
```

2. Which district had the highest total number of cases on July 30, 2020?
```{r}
malaria_long %>%
  filter(data_date == "2020-07-30") %>%
  group_by(district) %>%
  summarise(tot_cases=sum(cases, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(-tot_cases)
```

Bolo had the highest total number of cases.
