```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

1. Load the fish data. 
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
getwd()
fish <- read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

2. Transform the fish data to only include the variables lakeid and length.  Store this as a new dataframe called "fishlength".   
```{r}
names(fish)
fishlength <- select(fish, "lakeid", "length")
fishlength
```

3. Filter the `fish` data to include the samples from lake "BO".  
```{r}
samples <- filter(fish, lakeid == "BO")
samples
```

4. Calculate the mean length of fish from lake "BO".  
```{r}
mean(samples$length)
```
